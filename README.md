# mbrl-practice

This is where I'm storing random exercises I do while working through Suttons reinforcement learning text and familiarizing myself with model based reinforcement learning.

Due to the exploritory nature that I am approching these exercises from, some of them may be poorly structured and documented.

A1 was my first exersise. Guided by Curtis I experimented with a tabular sarsa algorithm for solving the gyms frozen lake problem.

In cartPole_basicGene I am experimenting with use of the gym library. See the internal comment for more details.
